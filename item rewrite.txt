Plans for Item Rewrite

--- TYPE ---
The type shall only hold one model.
Old cits which introduce multiple models based on predicates will be split and updated on the fly.


--- MODEL LOADING ---
All models loaded by citresewn will now have cit resewn's namespace and full absolute paths in the asset manager(defined formatting).

Provide full api for types for loading models to be used by more than the item type. (item type will do splitting logic; not the api)


--- RENDERING ---
Completely move cit resolution from getModel to the rendering paths that call it.

CrackParticle:<init>:42
modifyarg with captured context, forced single Mode.FIXED display mode.
extract particle sprite.

ItemEntityRenderer:render:68
modifyvar bakedModel, forced Mode.GROUND display mode.
needed for extra rendering transformations for item entity.

ItemRenderer:renderGuiItemModel:219
modifyvar model with captured context, forced Mode.GUI display mode

ItemRenderer:renderItem:121
modifyvar model with captured context, extract display mode from captured renderMode


--- BAKED MODEL FETCHING FROM TYPE ---
Must include display mode context in the getter so you could set the same CIT to different cache display modes.
Predicate checking needs to happen prior to cit fetching, cits now only hold their own model and multi model cits are split into multiple loaded cits.
